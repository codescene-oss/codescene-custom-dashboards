# Build Custom Dashboards using CodeScene's REST API

[CodeScene](https://codescene.com/) is the tool for identifying and prioritizing technical debt, measuring Code Health, as well as showing the outcomes in terms of shorter development time and a reduction in unplanned work.

CodeScene comes with its own UI, but sometimes you'd like to extract some key metrics and visualize them in your own business portal.
For that purpose, CodeScene offers a REST API which allows you to extract any metric or trend.

This repository provides an example on how to [visualize CodeScene data in Grafana](Grafana-QuickStart.md). Check it out üëç

## Examples on a custom dashboard

The following examples are created via the [Grafana quick start guide](Grafana-QuickStart.md).

### Visualize trends in unplanned work

Unplanned work is any task that you didn't plan for, typically a defect found in production or a crash. Excess levels of unplanned work 
are a common symptom of technical debt. CodeScene lets you visualize these trends:

### Build custom code quality dashboards

The Code Health metrics is the only code-level metric with a proven link to business outomes: higher Code Health gives shorter development times and fewer defects. 

Another key concept is the [hotspot analysis](https://codescene.com/blog/prioritize-technical-debt-by-impact/), which identifies the code with most development activity. When combined with the Code Health measure, you'll quickly identify the most expensive technical debt in any codebase. Here are some examples on how these numbers can be presented as high level KPIs:
